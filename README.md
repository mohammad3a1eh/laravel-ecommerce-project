This project is built with Laravel and React, inspired by the flexibility of WordPress, and designed to support any type of e-commerce website without limitations. The goal is to create a fully customizable platform where every element—products, categories, attributes, blog content, and more—can be dynamically managed. With server-side rendering, clean architecture, and a strong focus on SEO performance, this system aims to provide a solid, scalable foundation for building complete and production-ready online stores.

> This project is still under active development and not yet fully complete

This project is built on top of one of our existing Laravel starter templates, which provides the initial structure, authentication system, and core configuration. The template serves as the foundation for our extended e-commerce features and helps maintain clean architecture, scalability, and consistent development standards.

You can find the original template and its documentation here:

- Template Repository: [laravel-base](https://github.com/mohammad3a1eh/laravel-base)
